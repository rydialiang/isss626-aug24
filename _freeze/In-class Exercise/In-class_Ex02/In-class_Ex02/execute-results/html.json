However, we can download from Posit Public Package Manager snapshots by using the code chunk below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"maptools\",\n                 repos = \"https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-10-13\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npackage 'maptools' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpCYwpST\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n-   Avoid sp because we have to use maptools and maptools is retired as mentioned.\n\n-   Use sf straight. We can convert to ppp directly without more steps compared to sp.\n\n-   Shiny is developed by Posit. Dedicate support for Shiny repository. We can request Posit to have a repository required by you.\n:::\n",
