## Issue 1: Installing maptools

maptools is retired and binary is removed from CRAN. However, we can download from Posit Public Package Manager snapshots by using the code chunk below:

```{r}
install.packages("maptools",
                 repos = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-10-13")
```

::: callout-note
-   Avoid sp because we have to use maptools and maptools is retired as mentioned.

-   Use sf straight. We can convert to ppp directly without more steps compared to sp.

-   Shiny is developed by Posit. Dedicate support for Shiny repository. We can request Posit to have a repository required by you.
