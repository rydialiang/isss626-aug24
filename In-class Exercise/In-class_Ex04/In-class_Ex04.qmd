# **Spatial Weights and Applications**

## 1.0 What are Spatial Weights (wij)

It is a way to define spatial neighbourhood.

## 2.0 Contiguity Neighbours

Refer to [Hands on Ex 4 - 8.5.3.1 and 8.5.3.2](https://ry-geog.netlify.app/hands-on%20exercise/hands-on_ex04/hands-on_ex04#plotting-queen-contiguity-based-neighbours-map):

| Queen's                                           | Rook's (differences in blue circle)               |

## 2.1 Lagged Contiguity

## 2.2 Defining Spatial Weights

![](images/clipboard-3036623236.png)

A better measure of spatial weights will be using the third method, a general spatial distance weight matrices, where no boundaries were set (like distance criterion).

## 2.3 Weights Matrix: Distance-based neighbours

The weight matrix below is constructed using Queen's method.

**Quiz**: With reference to the figure above, list down the neighbour(s) of area 1202 using Rook case.

Neighbour of 1202 using Rook's case:

1.  1201
2.  1302
3.  901
4.  1000
5.  1102

### Weights Matrix: Distance-based neighbours

![](images/clipboard-3048454540.png)

Answer: (all distance, d \>650, will become 0 in value)

|        |   A |   B |   C |   D |   E |
|-------:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
|  **A** |   0 | 353 | 516 | 641 |   0 |
|  **B** | 353 |   0 | 357 |   0 |   0 |
|  **C** | 516 | 357 |   0 |   0 |   0 |
|  **D** | 641 |   0 |   0 |   0 | 263 |
|  **E** |   0 |   0 |   0 | 263 |   0 |

### Row standardisation

In practice, row-standardised weights instead of spatial weights will be used.

### Spatially Lagged Variables

Spatial lag with row-standardised weights.

## GDPCC (left) vs lag GDPCC (right)

-   Lag GDPCC smooth out the value, and help us identify the difference of the lighter western region and the darker regions to the north-east.

-   Ideally, we want to know which areas are with values that are statistically significant. Having 2 neighbours vs 6 neighbours? Next lesson!

### Spatial window sum

The spatial window sum uses and includes the diagonal element. (Include self = lag_sum)

### Comparing the visualisation to actual network

## Polygon Centroid Distance vs Network Distance

-   Centroid distance vs Network distance (e.g. shortest path)

-   It may take longer time to compute all possible shortest path.

-   Centroid distance generally simpler to calculate and it is quite similar to Network distance after aggregation.

-   However, there are many cases that network distance is a better measure.

    -   i.e. Rail network.
