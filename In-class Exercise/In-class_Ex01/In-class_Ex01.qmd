## 1.0 Loading Library and Data

This code chunk install and load the relevant package.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,sf,
               tmap,ggstatsplot)
```

This code chunk imports shapefile(.shp):

```{r}
mpsz14_shp = st_read(dsn = "data/", 
                  layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

This code chunk imports kml file(.kml):

```{r}
st_write(mpsz14_shp,
         "data/MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL.kml",
         delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

::: callout-note
-   for "delete_dsn" argument = TRUE, the file of the same name (mpsz14_shp) will be overwritten by the new file.
:::

## 2.0 Transformation / Re-projection

```{r}
mpsz19_shp <- st_read(dsn = "data/",
                  layer = "MPSZ-2019") %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

### Geographical Coordinate Systems

-   GCS define locations on the earth using a three-dimensional spherical surface. For example, WGS84.

-   They provides accuracy position information. Unit of measurement will be in either decimal degree or degree-minute-second format.

-   GCS, however, are not appropriate for distance and area measurements. In this figure, it is clear that 1 degree distance at the north pole is relatively shorter than 1 degree at the equator.

-   Refer to [9.1 Geographic Coordinate Systems](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/chp09_0.html#geographic-coordinate-systems) to learn more about GCS.

::: callout-note
### Projected Coordinate Systems (PCS)

-   Based on a map projection such as transverse Mercator, Albers equal area, or Robinson.

-   PCS provides consistent length and area measurement across space. Hence, it is important to transform a geospatial data from GCS to PCS before performing geospatial analysis.

-   Refer to [9.2 Projected Coordinate Systems](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/chp09_0.html#projected-coordinate-systems) to learn more about GCS.

## Transformation (st_transform)

-   technical term: re-projection

-   mpsz19_shp geometry changed.

### Choosing between excel and csv file


## 3.0 Population Data

```{r}
popdata2023 <- read_csv("data/respopagesextod2011to2020.csv")
```


```{r}
popdata2023 <- popdata2023 %>%
  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %>%
  summarise(POP = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = AG, values_from = POP)
colnames (popdata2023)
```
